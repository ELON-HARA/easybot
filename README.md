easybot
=======

Easybot is a trading tool able to load, save and draw candles from various sources. At today we support fetching trades from Bitcoincharts.com and Btce.com as well as loading previous calculated candles from CSV files.

This software was mainly inspired by this two projects:

[Gekko Trading Bot](https://github.com/askmike/gekko)

[tAPIbot](https://github.com/askmike/gekko)

While I was trying to understand some issues with this inspiring softwares, I found myself in need of some visual aid. While it's functional to understand some aspects of trading bots, the source code is quite messy as it was written in a few days.
